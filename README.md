# SQL-Projects
A collection of real-world SQL projects covering data cleaning, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and business logic implementation. Each project includes .sql scripts, datasets, and use-case-based solutions to showcase hands-on skills in querying, analysis, and relational database design.

**SQL_Project_1: ** This project showcases my foundational SQL skills. It includes designing a relational schema with four interconnected tables (employee, company, works, and manages), inserting sample data, and writing a series of 13 SQL queries that cover filtering, sorting, aggregation, subqueries, and conditional logic. The work was completed using MySQL Workbench and demonstrates practical application of core database concepts such as primary keys, composite keys, and data constraints.
