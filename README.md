# SQL-Projects
A collection of real-world SQL projects covering data cleaning, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and business logic implementation. Each project includes .sql scripts, datasets, and use-case-based solutions to showcase hands-on skills in querying, analysis, and relational database design.

**SQL_Project_1:** This project showcases my foundational SQL skills. It includes designing a relational schema with four interconnected tables (employee, company, works, and manages), inserting sample data, and writing a series of 13 SQL queries that cover filtering, sorting, aggregation, subqueries, and conditional logic. The work was completed using MySQL Workbench and demonstrates practical application of core database concepts such as primary keys, composite keys, and data constraints.

**SQL_Project2_2:** This project demonstrates my ability to design and query relational databases using SQL. It includes the creation of structured tables, data insertion, and a comprehensive set of SELECT queries ranging from basic filtering and aggregation to advanced multi-table JOINs. The queries handle use cases like identifying top earners, listing unborrowed records, summarising activity counts, and computing averages using functions like COUNT(), AVG(), CONCAT(), and DATEDIFF(). Through this, I worked with real-world scenarios involving employees, companies, and a digital library system, strengthening my skills in relational logic, data manipulation, and analytical SQL.
