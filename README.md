# SQL-Projects
A collection of real-world SQL projects covering data cleaning, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and business logic implementation. Each project includes .sql scripts, datasets, and use-case-based solutions to showcase hands-on skills in querying, analysis, and relational database design.

**SQL_Project_1:** This project showcases my foundational SQL skills. It includes designing a relational schema with four interconnected tables (employee, company, works, and manages), inserting sample data, and writing a series of 13 SQL queries that cover filtering, sorting, aggregation, subqueries, and conditional logic. The work was completed using MySQL Workbench and demonstrates practical application of core database concepts such as primary keys, composite keys, and data constraints.

**SQL_Project_2:** This project demonstrates my ability to design and query relational databases using SQL. It includes the creation of structured tables, data insertion, and a comprehensive set of SELECT queries ranging from basic filtering and aggregation to advanced multi-table JOINs. The queries handle use cases like identifying top earners, listing unborrowed records, summarising activity counts, and computing averages using functions like COUNT(), AVG(), CONCAT(), and DATEDIFF(). Through this, I worked with real-world scenarios involving employees, companies, and a digital library system, strengthening my skills in relational logic, data manipulation, and analytical SQL.

**SQL_Project_3:** This SQL project showcases my ability to design, manipulate, and query relational databases using structured, real-world scenarios. It begins with the creation of multiple interconnected tables, covering key aspects of database design including primary keys, composite keys, default values, and foreign key constraints (including self-referencing constraints). It includes structured data insertion for simulating realistic employee and company datasets, followed by a comprehensive series of queries using SQLâ€™s SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, and MAX. The project further demonstrates proficiency in multi-table operations through inner and outer JOINs, conditional filtering using BETWEEN, pattern matching with LIKE, and subqueries for comparative analysis. Additionally, it incorporates non-SELECT DML operations such as UPDATE and DELETE, and DDL tasks like ALTER TABLE for renaming and applying foreign key constraints. Together, these elements reflect end-to-end coverage of database fundamentals through clean, well-documented SQL scripts ready for use in data analysis, application backends, or production database environments.
