# SQL-Projects
A collection of real-world SQL projects covering data cleaning, joins, subqueries, aggregation, and business logic implementation. Each project includes .sql scripts, datasets, and use-case-based solutions to showcase hands-on skills in querying, analysis, and relational database design.

**SQL_Project_1:** This project showcases my foundational SQL skills. It includes designing a relational schema with four interconnected tables (employee, company, works, and manages), inserting sample data, and writing a series of 13 SQL queries that cover filtering, sorting, aggregation, subqueries, and conditional logic. The work was completed using MySQL Workbench and demonstrates practical application of core database concepts such as primary keys, composite keys, and data constraints.

**SQL_Project_2:** This project demonstrates my ability to design and query relational databases using SQL. It includes the creation of structured tables, data insertion, and a comprehensive set of SELECT queries ranging from basic filtering and aggregation to advanced multi-table JOINs. The queries handle use cases like identifying top earners, listing unborrowed records, summarising activity counts, and computing averages using functions like COUNT(), AVG(), CONCAT(), and DATEDIFF(). Through this, I worked with real-world scenarios involving employees, companies, and a digital library system, strengthening my skills in relational logic, data manipulation, and analytical SQL.

**SQL_Project_3:** This SQL project showcases my ability to design, manipulate, and query relational databases using structured, real-world scenarios. It begins with the creation of multiple interconnected tables, covering key aspects of database design including primary keys, composite keys, default values, and foreign key constraints (including self-referencing constraints). It includes structured data insertion for simulating realistic employee and company datasets, followed by a comprehensive series of queries using SQL’s SELECT, WHERE, ORDER BY, GROUP BY, and aggregate functions like COUNT, AVG, and MAX. The project further demonstrates proficiency in multi-table operations through inner and outer JOINs, conditional filtering using BETWEEN, pattern matching with LIKE, and subqueries for comparative analysis. Additionally, it incorporates non-SELECT DML operations such as UPDATE and DELETE, and DDL tasks like ALTER TABLE for renaming and applying foreign key constraints. Together, these elements reflect end-to-end coverage of database fundamentals through clean, well-documented SQL scripts ready for use in data analysis, application backends, or production database environments.

**SQL_Project_4:** This project demonstrates end-to-end SQL proficiency through the design, implementation, and querying of a relational database inspired by a real-world rental platform. It includes structured table creation using appropriate data types and constraints, insertion of test data across entities such as hosts, guests, properties, and bookings, and the use of ALTER TABLE to modify the schema with default values. Logical data updates were applied using conditional filtering (WHERE clause), and diverse queries were written to extract insights using INNER JOIN, ORDER BY, IN, and DATEDIFF functions. The project also includes the creation of a VIEW to simplify reporting, showcasing clean joins between multiple tables. This SQL solution reflects practical skills in data modelling, integrity enforcement through foreign keys, and efficient data retrieval for reporting and analysis tasks. 

**SQL_Project_5:** This project demonstrates advanced relational database design and manipulation using both standard SQL and Oracle PL/SQL. It includes the creation of multiple interconnected tables with appropriate constraints and keys, data population for realistic datasets (employees, properties, bookings, customers, and invoices), and a wide range of queries for analysis and reporting. The project showcases proficiency in writing JOIN queries, using aggregate and date functions, and implementing schema modifications (ALTER, UPDATE, DELETE). In addition, it includes PL/SQL components such as row-level triggers to update balances dynamically, stored procedures to encapsulate business logic for data insertion, and user-defined functions to retrieve computed values. This comprehensive SQL+PLSQL portfolio reflects practical expertise in database development, back-end logic design, and transactional data handling in both MySQL and Oracle environments.

**SQL_Project_6:** This project showcases a complete end-to-end web application workflow using HTML, PHP, and MySQL, built and tested locally with XAMPP. It features a simple yet functional customer input form (index.html) that collects user details such as first name, last name, email, and phone number. Upon submission, the data is securely sent to a PHP backend (insert.php), which establishes a connection to a MySQL database and executes an INSERT query to store the information in a customer table. The project demonstrates practical skills in client-server communication, form handling, SQL integration, and local hosting. It effectively simulates how modern web applications interact with relational databases and can be extended to include additional CRUD operations or front-end enhancements.
